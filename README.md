# Travelling_Salesman_Problem (TSP)

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. 
Given  N  points in a plane, we want to find the shortest path that visits all  N  points and returns to the starting point. It is called an NP-Hard problem because it is impossible to find the least cost of connecting all points in the graph. 
However, we can use Markov chains to find an approximate solution. I will demonstrate Markov chains to find an approximate solution for the TSP in R.
